Define Moore’s law and explain why it has now stopped being true. Be sure to describe all of the physical limitations that have prevented Moore’s law from continuing to be true.





According to Wikipedia, Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. Moore's law is an observation and projection of a historical trend. Rather than a law of physics, it is an empirical relationship linked to gains from experience in production.
